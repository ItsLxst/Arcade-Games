# 🕹️ Arcade Games

Welcome to the **Arcade Games** repository! This project is a collection of classic retro games rebuilt using Python and the Turtle graphics library. 

The goal is to recreate the nostalgic feeling of old-school arcade cabinets while mastering Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## 📂 Game Status

Here is the current development status of the games in this collection:

| Game | Status | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **🐍 Snake Game** | ✅ **Completed** | The classic snake game. Control the snake, eat food, and grow without hitting the walls or your own tail. |
| **🏓 Pong Game** | ✅ **Completed** | The famous 2D table tennis simulation. Two players, one ball, endless competition. |
| **🐢 Crossy Turtle** | ✅ **Completed** | Help the turtle cross a busy highway filled with fast-moving cars. Avoid getting squished! |

## 🎮 Game Controls

Don't dive into the code! Here is how you play the games:

| Game | Player | Keys | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
